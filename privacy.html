            <h2>How We Protect Your Payment Information</h2>
            
            <h3>Encryption Technology</h3>
            <p>At GreenSteps Community Garden, all payments are safeguarded through SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. This technology ensures a protected link between your browser and our servers, keeping every transaction private and secure.</p>
            
            <h3>Tokenization</h3>
            <p>At GreenSteps Community Garden, we use tokenization to keep your payment details safe. This process replaces sensitive financial data with unique tokens that carry the necessary information for transactions, without exposing or compromising your security.</p>
            
            <h3>PCI DSS Compliance</h3>
            <p>GreenSteps Community Garden is fully compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). This means we strictly follow global standards when storing, processing, and transmitting credit or debit card information.</p>
            
            <h3>Secure Payment Gateways</h3>
            <p>We work with trusted payment processors that specialize in secure online transactions. Your payment details are never stored on our systems, but are handled directly by these certified providers.</p>
